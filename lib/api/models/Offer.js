/**
 * About:
 * The offer object represents a marketplace offer.
 *
 * Returned by:
 * The offer object is returned by the Product Request using the optional offers parameter and is part of the Product Object.
 *
 * Important to know:
 * It is impossible to update billions of marketplace offers on a regular basis. The product request's offers parameter determines how many offers we retrieve/update.
 * We always fetch the best offers, as sorted by Amazon, in all conditions. If a product has more offers than requested, those will not be retrieved.
 *
 * The order of offers constantly changes, and we can retrieve a different amount of offers with each data retrieval.
 * Because of this, as well as the fact that we keep a history of offers, you will almost certainly encounter outdated offers.
 *
 * So the following is very important:
 *
 * - Evaluate the `lastSeen` fieldâ€”only process fresh and active offers if you are not interested in past offers.
 * - The history of an offer (its past prices and shipping costs) is often not without gaps.
 *   Evaluate the `EXTRA_INFO_UPDATES` csv-type of the product object to find out when we updated the offers.
 *   If you need complete coverage of (all) offers of a product, you have to request it on a regular basis.
 * - If there are almost identical offers (same seller, same condition, same shipping type, and same condition text),
 *   we only provide access to the one with the cheapest price. We do not list duplicates.
